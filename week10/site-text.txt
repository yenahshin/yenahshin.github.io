FCD SURFBOARDS
Made in Ventura, California.
At FCD, the surf experience runs deep. For the last 20 years, we've been dedicated to building the best boards we can using the lightest and strongest blanks and glass. But our work goes beyond that: It includes a commitment to constant innovation through testing boards in the lab and the water to develop higher-performing designs and construction techniques. We build in Ventura from start to finish, using lower-impact materials and processes to minimize the environmental damage caused by surfboard production.
