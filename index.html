        <h3>Reading Response: "The Web's Grain"</h3>
        <p> This reading showed a very interesting perspective about the web. The fact that he worked on the internet for so long and that he has so much experience in the field is extraordinary because he has seen the development of the web. This reading reminds me of a reading I had in my Typography II class last semester. The piece was called "The Crytal Goblet" (1930) by Beatrice Warde. It was the first piece we read before we started to design our own book. She talks about how printing should be invisible. As in the design isn't the important part, and it's the designer's job to get the words the the reader, in the most simple and transparent way possible without distracting the reader with the design. Hence the title, "The Crystal Goblet".

        <p> "In pursuit of convenience, we have opened the door to unscrupulous influence."</p>
        <p>While reading this piece, Cimero mentioned a lot of aspects of technology that I've been thinking about. I'm a technology enthusiast. I'm always researching about new tech that is coming out and just interested in all things that are technology-related. Even today, I was telling my friends how I miss the art of letter writing, because technology is really taking over our lives. It's convenient and we can't imagine our lives without it but that's the alarming part. So like Cimero said, I undoubtedly think that it's up to us to draw that line and ask ourselves "what is technologyâ€™s role in your life? And what, really, do you want from it?"   </p>
